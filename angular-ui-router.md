# Routing with
# ui-router

---

# Objectives

- Explain state as it relates to ui-router.
- List three features that you are looking forward to exploring in ui-router.
- Explore a site that uses ui-router.

---

> The biggest difference when you start working with ui-router is the concept of state.

---

> State is a **place** in your application and that is how parts of your application should be defined, **not by a URL**

---

# What can you do with ui-router?

---

> You can choose to change the url or not.

---

> You can have multiple <ui-view> directives on a page.

---

> You can have nested routes. e.g. **http://localhost:3000/books/mystery/**

---

> You can name your routes and change the state from the controller
### e.g. (**$state.go(books.mystery)**)

---

> And you can change state from the view
### e.g. (**ui-sref='books.mystery'**)

---
> You can use the state to make css changes
### (**ui-sref-active**)
